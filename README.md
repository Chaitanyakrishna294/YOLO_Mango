🍃 Advanced Mango Disease Detection Using YOLO + Edge Enhancement

This project implements a YOLO-based deep learning model to detect and classify mango leaf diseases with high accuracy. To improve feature extraction, a Canny edge-enhanced channel is added to the input, helping the model focus on leaf texture, disease boundaries, and infection patterns.

To further boost performance, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is used for hyperparameter tuning—resulting in significantly better accuracy and model stability. The system is designed to support early detection, helping farmers and agricultural teams take timely action.
